# Overview of the basic declarative agent example

This app contains the sample for the declarative agent for Ignite 2024 using the Graph Connector as a data source. This will allow the user to query the data for the Graph Connector e.g. Ignite 2024 Session Catalogue in the Copilot agent.

## What is a declarative agent

With the declarative agent, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot declarative agent can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to Copilot.
